#Note that a command window can only run one thing at a time, and the command window you opened earlier is running the web server. As long as the web server is running and waiting for additional incoming requests, the terminal will accept new text but will not execute new commands.

#To type additional commands while the web server is running, open a new terminal window and activate your virtualenv -- to review instructions on how to open a second terminal window, see Introduction to the command line. To stop the web server, switch back to the window in which it's running and press CTRL+C - Control and C keys together (on Windows, you might have to press Ctrl+Break).
